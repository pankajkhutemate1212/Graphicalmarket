This would push Santos’s output up by 25 percent and would also bolster its status in the global gas market.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shares of Santos were up 7 percent on Monday after it took over ConocoPhillips, the second acquisition within a time period of a year. The company has been lifted from the dumps by Managing Director Kevin Gallagher.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matt Fox, Chief Operating Officer of ConocoPhillips, said in a statement that while the Darwin LNG backfill project is one with lower costs associated with supply, its sale raises capital to be invested in other projects of the company. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sale of the plant comes as the Bayu-Undan gas field is expected to dry up by 2022. Therefore, the management made a decision to sell it to Santos which would be developing the Barossa field.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The company said that the deal would be finalized by the first quarter of 2020. It is anticipated that it would result in a positive effect on the earnings per share of Santos by 16 percent and also push production up by 25 percent in the coming year. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Australian energy company has also said that it would be ready to invest another $75 million if a decision is reached in regards to the Barossa field by ConocoPhillips.

13,"China pushes for removal of more tariffs in the Phase one trade deal with the US","People having knowledge of the matter said on Monday that China is pushing for the removal of more tariffs imposed by the United States in September as part of the phase one trade deal between the two nations.

The phase one deal is expected to be signed by President Trump and President Xi Jinping by this month. But the location of the agreement has not yet been decided. It is widely believed that the deal would involve the United States removing import duties on $156 billion worth of Chinese goods that are currently scheduled for December 15.

A source informed reports that Chinese officials have demanded for removal of 15 percent tariffs imposed on Chinese imports in September this year. Besides that, China is also aiming to get rid of the 25 percent tariffs on about $250 billion worth of their goods.

The Financial Times newspaper earlier published a report claiming that the White House was pondering upon whether to remove tariffs that went into effect on September 1. The 15 percent tariffs were imposed on some clothing items, Bluetooth headphones, speakers and televisions being imported from China.

A spokesman of the Chinese foreign ministry said that negotiations between the two countries have made progress and are on track according to plans. He added that imposing more and more import duties is not a solution to issues in trade.

Director of the China program at the Eurasia Center, Ralph Winnie, said that closing the phase one deal would allow both the economies to boost up their growth and would also give Trump a win among farmers.

The Chinese president on Tuesday said that the countries should oppose protectionist measures and also protect intellectual property rights.

This comes partly because of a longer warm season which took a toll on demand for winter products. The drop in sales was higher than analysts’ expectations of 1 percent.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the reasons Macy’s experienced lower demand was because of weak international tourism. Besides that, the company’s website was also having some issues due to “preparation for the last quarter of the year”.</span>

104,"Turbine installation completed at Taiwan’s Formosa 1 offshore wind farm","Renewable energy sources have evolved as one of the best alternative sources of energy and have gained importance and recognition on a global scale. As Taiwan imports <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309160880_A_review_of_renewable_energies_in_Taiwan"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">over 97%</a> of its energy supply from foreign countries, developing an independent renewable energy is a priority for the developing nation. To fulfil this vision, Taiwan has actively initiated new wind and solar projects.

A development was recently made this sector when installation at Taiwan’s first offshore commercial wind farm, the 128MW Formosa 1 project, was announced to be completed; effectively setting a benchmark for the Asian renewable energy sector.

Tsai Chao-yang, Chairman of Swancor Holding, said that the installation of 20 SGRE (Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy) 6MW turbines in the waters off Miaoli County marks the first offshore wind project in Asia outside of China.

Taiwan’s Minister of Economic Affairs, Shen Jong-chin, has prior claimed that the Formosa 1 wind farm would become fully operational till the end of this year, after it acquires its electricity generation license.

Three years ago, Swancor Holding completed the 1st phase of Formosa 1 by installing two 4MW turbines, becoming a pioneer in offshore wind energy in the island. The government of Taiwan aims to install 5.7GW offshore wind by 2025 and is planning to spur another 5GW by late 2020s.

As per reports, Swancor is prepared to retreat from the sector following this projects completion. In July, the company has announced that it would <a href=""https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/1831151/pioneering-taiwanese-offshore-developer-sold-to-us-investment-firm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">sell 95%</a> of its Swancor Renewable Energy (SRE) arm, which is the co-owner and co-developer of Formosa 1 and Formosa 2 project, to Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners.

According to Tsai, Stonepeak transaction would complete shortly and Formosa 2 will be the next priority of the Stonepeak-led SRE, with critical tasks consisting of finance and completion agreement with local fishery association.

For the record, the Formosa 2 project is planned to commence construction next year and come online by 2021.

109,"Moderna enrolls its first patient in Phase 1/2 trial for mRNA-3704","Moderna, a US-based biopharmaceutical company, reportedly announced that the first patient in its Phase 1/2 trial has been enrolled to help evaluate the tolerability and safety of intensifying doses of mRNA-3704 given via intravenous infusion for patients suffering from isolated MMA (methylmalonic acidemia) due to MUT deficiency. This is the company’s first rare disease program to start clinical study enrollment.

The enrolled patient has entered in an observational period before the treatment, which evaluates the baseline disease of the patient before initiating the therapy period. The LNP (lipid nanoparticle) formulation utilized for mRNA-3704 is also used in mRNA-1944 (the company’s chikungunya antibody program), which recently showed positive interim Phase 1 outcomes.

The Phase 1/2 open-label trial is created to assess the tolerability and safety of approximately four scaling dose levels of mRNA-3704 given via intravenous infusion among patients one year or older with isolated MMA caused due to hMUT (methylmalonyl-CoA mutase) deficiency with increased plasma methylmalonic acid, a key metabolite which accumulates in disorder.

Chief Medical Officer, Moderna, Tal Zaks, M.D., Ph.D., stated that this trial would provide vital information about the capability of mRNA approach for replacement of the deficient enzyme in patients suffering from MMA, which presently has no authorized medical treatment or investigational medicines that can address the underlying cause.

Zaks further added that as the first of the company’s rare disease programs to start clinical trial enrollment, the company looks forward to hearing from the enrolled patients and families in the company’s clinical study as it investigates and advances an mRNA platform that might help treat this challenging condition.

The U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has granted mRNA-3704 with Orphan Drug, Fast Track, and Rare Pediatric Disease designation. mRNA-3704 has also received orphan designation by the EMA (European Medicines Agency). Moderna is presently planning to start its several sites outside the United States and thus far got MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) approval in U.K.

Credible sources cite, this new Model 3 variant would have a greater driving range. Like the existing Model 3 that is made in China, which boasts of a standard range of over 400 kilometers, the new variant would also be a rear-wheel-drive vehicle.

The new China-made Model 3 Long Range RWD is another version of Model 3 which was previously discontinued in the United States. The company has already manufactured more than 2,000 cars this year.

Tesla offered the Model 3 vehicle along with a Long Range battery pack and RWD (rear-wheel-drive) configuration when it first launched the Model 3 car.

However, this model was discontinued later as the company began to offer the Long Range battery together with a dual-motor AWD (all-wheel-drive) drivetrain.

Tesla, which began delivering its cars from December 2019 from the its $2 billion Tesla Shanghai factory, also sells imported Model 3s with a longer-range and an all-wheel drive across China.

The EV maker began manufacturing from its Shanghai factory on Monday following the end of an extended government holiday which was put in place owing to the coronavirus outbreak in the country.

The shares of the company surged by 9% after the reopening of the Shanghai factory.

Speaking of the factory closure due to coronavirus outbreak, Xu Wei, Shanghai municipal government spokesman stated that considering the practical problems major vehicle manufacturing companies have faced during the resuming of their production activities, the government would take efforts to help automakers restart their manufacturing activities as soon as possible.

It was expected that the Tesla Shanghai factory closure would delay some Model 3 deliveries. However, this shutdown is not expected to make a significant impact on the automobile manufacturer’s Q1 financial results, given that the new Shanghai factory has yet to establish itself as a major revenue contributor.

139,"Greenlots &amp; Volvo team up for installation of first EV charging hub","Greenlots, a member of Shell Group, has reportedly announced that it has partnered with Volvo as part of its LIGHTS electric trucking project to install the first of four installations of heavy-duty fleet charging stations.

Both Greenlots and Volvo announced plans for installing the new infrastructure for fleet charging under a partnership with Volvo Trucks. The heavy-duty fleet electric vehicle (EV) charging installation is the first installation out of four pre-planned installations by the company for warehouses throughout Southern California. The new charging stations are specifically designed to be used by fleets to facilitate the use of heavy-duty electric trucks, such as those manufactured by Volvo Trucks, across Southern California.

Harmeet Singh, Chief Technology Officer, Greenlots, stated that heavy-duty fleets have distinct charging needs and characteristics. The SKY platform of Greenlots is created for scale and designed to deliver a charging solution to meet unique requirements of Volvo’s fleet and is enhanced for power and cost.

The very first installation in Fontana comprises of two fully operational 50kW DC fast charging stations along with plans to install an additional 150kW station in the coming weeks. Greenlots’ SKY Electric Vehicle Charging Network Software would manage the stations as well as permit centralized visibility of the electric trucks and charging stations. They have the capability to handle the demand these stations put on the local grid since it relates the use of the attached facility of warehouse as well as the requirements of the fleet.

The new installations are part of the larger Volvo LIGHTS (Low Impact Green Heavy Transport Solutions) project, which focuses on leveraging a mix of both private and public funding to level up charging of fleet for heavy vehicles in the upcoming years.

Initially the program was proposed to CARB (California Air Resources Board) as a possible solution to the emissions caused from the overload of heavy trucks flowing in and out of the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to warehouses throughout the Los Angeles basin.

CARB in response to the proposal by Volvo, granted $44.8 million to the Volvo LIGHTS project to match the amount of funds, approximately $45.9 million, that Volvo would invest in the project.

145,"Apple to reopen five stores in Beijing for limited hours on 14th Feb","Amidst the ongoing concerns over coronavirus outbreak, Apple comes as a bearer of good news for Chinese tech space as it plans to reopen five of its Beijing stores. These are the very first stores to be reopened since Apple choose to close all its retail stores in China; however, this news comes with a pinch of salt as these five stores would only be open for limited hours.

According to reliable sources, these five stores include Apple Mall China, Sanlitun, Wangfujing, Xidan Joy City, and Chaoyang Joy City, which are likely to reopen on the 14th from 11 AM to 6 PM. Before the outbreak, these stores used to operate from 10 AM to 10 PM.

As of now, Apple hasn’t cleared the air on reopening its remaining retail stores in China, while it plans to reopen these five stores in Beijing stores.

Reportedly, coronavirus, which is scientifically named COVID-19, has amped up its death toll to 1,370 while 60,000 patients are placed under confirmed cases. The World Health Organization has even declared it as a global public health emergency, with the American state department releasing a travel advisory as airlines independently slash the number of flights to China.

As an aftermath of this incident, organizers were forced to cancel key events like MWC 2020 over the last few weeks.

In other news, <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136730/youtube-tv-ending-apple-app-store-in-app-subscription"">YouTube TV</a> is planning to pull the plug on Apple devices as it decides to end its subscription revenue sharing alliance with Apple. Previously, YouTube TV had stopped taking new signups from iPhone's and iPad’s in-app subscriptions, but now the entertainment platform has ended all ties with Apple.

As a matter of fact, YouTube is sending emails to YouTube TV users, stating its intention to shut down support for in-app payments entirely in March. As a result, Apple users would have to subscribe through a web browser.

Meanwhile, other popular services, like Spotify, are also following the same trend by restricting new subscriptions via in-app purchases. However, Spotify still allows its existing users to continue their subscription through Apple devices.

158,"General Motors announces closure of its Holden unit in Australia","U.S. auto giant, General Motors has recently announced that it will be pulling the plug on its Australian Holden division. Holden played a special role in creating cult classics like Pontiac G8, Chevrolet SS, and Pontiac GTO.

This decision, which some experts had already foreseen, comes just after GM had shut down its locally producing automobiles in Australia. The 160-year-old automaker is renowned for creating its special lineup of icons like the Sandman, Monaro, the Commodore, and the ute.

Reportedly, General Motors issued a formal statement revealing that the decision to cut off Holden was in line to boost the transformation of global markets. In simple terms, the automaker is planning to withdraw its presence from the right-hand drive markets.

By closing Holden, GM would also end its business in New Zealand. Moreover, it is also planning to pull Chevrolet from Thailand, a prominent right-hand-drive market.

Speaking on the move, Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO, GM, said that in hard times the company has to overhaul its strategic plan and restructure its international operations. This move would help it focus on those markets where it has right strategies to record commendable returns.

Moreover, the company is planning to prioritize its global investments towards the growth of electric vehicle segments and self-driving cars.

Meanwhile, for Holden, it would go down as a street legend in the pages of Australian automotive history, as GM closes its Melbourne-based design center, winds down its financial services and closes the doors of its local Lang Lang engineering center and proving grounds.

However, all warranties and future recall-related activities would be honored by the after-sales network. In addition to this, a “specialty vehicle business” of GM would stay in Australia, fulfilling the import demands for mid-engine Corvette and Chevy Camaro.

170,"Google Cloud announces acquisition of Cornerstone Technology","Google Cloud has reportedly acquired technology solution provider, Cornerstone Technology, to help users migrate their mainframe data. For the record, Cornerstone Technology helps organizations to migrate mainframe data through a highly automated process. The company helps clients to convert databases and languages to prepare applications for advanced environments.

Howard Weale, Director of Enterprise Transformation Practice, Google Cloud, said that as the industry is building applications as a set of services, most of the clients are inclined towards breaking their mainframe programs into either Java microservices or Java monoliths. This approach for application modernization is the core of the Cornerstone toolset.

Weale added that with automated processes, Cornerstone’s tools could break down PL/1, Assembler or Cobol programs into services and later make them cloud-native, such as within a containerized, managed environment.

Reportedly, this deal is one of a series of acquisitions Google has completed in recent years to help consumers to migrate to the Cloud. In the previous year, Google acquired the data migration startup company, Alooma and CloudSimple, a software company that lets clients run and migrate VMware workloads natively in public clouds.

In the year 2018, Google purchased Velostrata to empower enterprise customers to transfer large-scale VM systems and workloads.

Whilst mainframes are still considered to power critical workloads, moving them to the cloud is extremely complex task for enterprises. Cornerstone is taking proactive steps to cater to this issue of enterprise clients.

Recently, Google also announced support for IBM Power Systems in its Cloud. This move would help IBM to move their legacy systems into the Cloud. Earlier this year, the company introduced premium support services and has created new partnerships with cybersecurity firms. Google recently revealed that its cloud business has hit a mark of USD10 billion annual revenue run rate.

184,"Australia to invest $726 million for upgradation of Northern Airbase","<ul>
 	<li><strong>The upgraded air base is expected to support US Air Force launch missions into Indo-Pacific.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Based in town of Katherine, RAAF Base Tindal would house country’s new fleet of F-35 strike fighters post completion.</strong></li>
</ul>
The Australian government has recently announced investing a remuneration of USD 726 million on the grounds of upgrading an airbase across the northern territory, RAAF Base Tindal. This development is expected to magnify Australia and the US’s military armory in the Pacific.

According to reliable reports, the base in town of Katherine, will be a home to country’s new fleet of F-35 strike fighters, post the completion of project by the end of 2027. Moreover, it would support the country’s Air Force launch missions into the Indo-Pacific.

It has been claimed that a huge share of the investment, USD 737 million, would be spent on expanding the runway and building new fuel storage infrastructure to enable the base to deal with larger aircrafts like Australian refueling and US long range bombers aircrafts.

Industry experts have cited a revelation claiming that RAAF Base Tindal has emerged to be known as one of Australia’s most strategically vital defense precincts.

Speaking on the matter, the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison commented that the development of Airbase would be integral of country’s alliance with the US and would potentially bolster the reach of Air Force capabilities in the Pacific. He further added that RAAF Base Tindal would be able to offer improved air support and air to air refueling, along with supporting ADF operations throughout the region.

As per credible sources, this move is indicative of Australian government and Department of Defense’s drive to augment its capabilities in the northern part of Australia, considering its renewed focus on the Indo-Pacific.

Australia has been leveraging unchecked influence in the Pacific since a very long now which has been challenged progressively by China in the recent years. However, China has denied using financial assistance to gain power in the region.

191,"AusCann strikes distribution agreement in medicinal cannabis","In what seemed like an audacious step, AusCann has struck an exclusive storage and distribution agreement with Clifford Hallam Healthcare (CH2), a national pharmaceuticals provider. AusCann was quoted saying that the agreement to distribute and store its pharmaceutical products would extend the company’s distribution footprint in the Australian shores and would prove to be cost-effective.

AusCann was reported saying that pharmacies for AusCann will receive the products supplied by CH2, which would adhere to the regulations overseeing the supply of an unregistered medicine.

The deal will be valid for 12 months with an option to extend further. Notably, the deal replaces the heads of agreement inked by AusCann with Australian Pharmaceutical Industries Limited in early 2018.

The company says that the agreement marks yet another step on their path towards making available the hard-shell capsules for prescription and clinical evaluation to patients through the therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) special access scheme and authorized prescriber scheme during the first half of 2020 in Australia.

The company emphasizes production, development and cannabinoid-based medicines in the Australia shores and overseas. The company described itself as bringing a paradigm shift in the way medicinal cannabis was supplied by making dose-controlled, standardized, cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical products and clinical evidence accessible to physicians, patients and healthcare providers.

The Perth-based company allows physicians to treat their patients with a stable, reliable and standardized cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical product, adjust treatment algorithms and monitor treatment results using a portfolio of formulations and products.

AusCann is set to receive cannabis resin following the three-year deal inked with Tasmanian Alkaloids in Q3 2019. With an option of a three-year extension, it would supply minimum 30% of cannabis resin of AusCann for three years.

<strong>About AusCann</strong>

194,"CITC inks an agreement to offer FTTH broadband services across Saudi","<ul>
 	<li><strong>The deal inked between Telecom Service Providers would boost and augment competition in the broadband market across Saudi Arabia.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Through this initiative, subscribers get a chance to opt their FTTH service provider independently of fiber facility ownership.</strong></li>
</ul>
Saudi Arabia’s telecoms regulator, the Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC), has signed an open access pact offering fiber to the home (FTTH) broadband services via any subscriber-selected service provider, to the states of Saudi Arabia. The agreement, which was inked in February 23<sup>rd</sup>, aims at encouraging competition, increasing broadband subscriptions, and attracting investment by enhancing the service quality and customer choice.

It has been reported that the agreement was signed by the CEOs of STC, Zain, Mobily, Etihad Atheeb Telecom, Integrated Dawiyat, and Integrated Telecom Company.

According to reliable sources, it is the first time ever that a telecom regulator, CITC, has primarily driven the signing of a nation wide active infrastructure sharing deal amidst all operators in the telecoms market. Moreover, nearly ten commercial agreements have been signed recently between the operators post the completion of 90 workshops governed by Fiber Bitstream Rules and Guidelines published by CITC in November last year.

Speaking on the matter, the governor of CITC, Dr. Mohammed Al Tamimi, cited that the adoption of an open access model would positively increase the use of its fiber-optic infrastructure through the development of commercial agreements which makes its easer for the subscribers to move from one provider to the other. Additionally, he praised the level of cooperation between the participating telecom operators throughout the development of open access initiative.

Speculations have it that the Kingdom’s digital transformation has significantly been bolstered post the launch of Vision 2030, with its ICT sector being valued at USD 28.7 billion, the largest in Arab world. Besides, as per the International Telecommunication Union, Saudi Arabia posses an internet penetration of nearly 93 per cent when compared to the global average of 53 per cent.
