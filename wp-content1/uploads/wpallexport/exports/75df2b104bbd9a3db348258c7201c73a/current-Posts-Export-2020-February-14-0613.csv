This would push Santos’s output up by 25 percent and would also bolster its status in the global gas market.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shares of Santos were up 7 percent on Monday after it took over ConocoPhillips, the second acquisition within a time period of a year. The company has been lifted from the dumps by Managing Director Kevin Gallagher.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matt Fox, Chief Operating Officer of ConocoPhillips, said in a statement that while the Darwin LNG backfill project is one with lower costs associated with supply, its sale raises capital to be invested in other projects of the company. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sale of the plant comes as the Bayu-Undan gas field is expected to dry up by 2022. Therefore, the management made a decision to sell it to Santos which would be developing the Barossa field.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The company said that the deal would be finalized by the first quarter of 2020. It is anticipated that it would result in a positive effect on the earnings per share of Santos by 16 percent and also push production up by 25 percent in the coming year. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Australian energy company has also said that it would be ready to invest another $75 million if a decision is reached in regards to the Barossa field by ConocoPhillips.

13,"China pushes for removal of more tariffs in the Phase one trade deal with the US","People having knowledge of the matter said on Monday that China is pushing for the removal of more tariffs imposed by the United States in September as part of the phase one trade deal between the two nations.

The phase one deal is expected to be signed by President Trump and President Xi Jinping by this month. But the location of the agreement has not yet been decided. It is widely believed that the deal would involve the United States removing import duties on $156 billion worth of Chinese goods that are currently scheduled for December 15.

A source informed reports that Chinese officials have demanded for removal of 15 percent tariffs imposed on Chinese imports in September this year. Besides that, China is also aiming to get rid of the 25 percent tariffs on about $250 billion worth of their goods.

The Financial Times newspaper earlier published a report claiming that the White House was pondering upon whether to remove tariffs that went into effect on September 1. The 15 percent tariffs were imposed on some clothing items, Bluetooth headphones, speakers and televisions being imported from China.

A spokesman of the Chinese foreign ministry said that negotiations between the two countries have made progress and are on track according to plans. He added that imposing more and more import duties is not a solution to issues in trade.

Director of the China program at the Eurasia Center, Ralph Winnie, said that closing the phase one deal would allow both the economies to boost up their growth and would also give Trump a win among farmers.

The Chinese president on Tuesday said that the countries should oppose protectionist measures and also protect intellectual property rights. He also mentioned China’s pledge to open its economy to the world.",2019-11-05,https://www.theresearchprocess.com/2019/11/05/china-pushes-for-removal-of-more-tariffs-in-the-phase-one-trade-deal-with-the-us/,"Business News|General News",https://www.theresearchprocess.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Xi-Jinping-1.jpg|https://www.theresearchprocess.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Xi-Jinping.jpg,sharp-elbakyan

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Trade experts believe that the conclusion of the Phase One trade deal between the two nations may be pushed to next year as China demands rollback of tariffs that were imposed during the trade war.

109,"Moderna enrolls its first patient in Phase 1/2 trial for mRNA-3704","Moderna, a US-based biopharmaceutical company, reportedly announced that the first patient in its Phase 1/2 trial has been enrolled to help evaluate the tolerability and safety of intensifying doses of mRNA-3704 given via intravenous infusion for patients suffering from isolated MMA (methylmalonic acidemia) due to MUT deficiency. This is the company’s first rare disease program to start clinical study enrollment.

The enrolled patient has entered in an observational period before the treatment, which evaluates the baseline disease of the patient before initiating the therapy period. The LNP (lipid nanoparticle) formulation utilized for mRNA-3704 is also used in mRNA-1944 (the company’s chikungunya antibody program), which recently showed positive interim Phase 1 outcomes.

The Phase 1/2 open-label trial is created to assess the tolerability and safety of approximately four scaling dose levels of mRNA-3704 given via intravenous infusion among patients one year or older with isolated MMA caused due to hMUT (methylmalonyl-CoA mutase) deficiency with increased plasma methylmalonic acid, a key metabolite which accumulates in disorder.

Chief Medical Officer, Moderna, Tal Zaks, M.D., Ph.D., stated that this trial would provide vital information about the capability of mRNA approach for replacement of the deficient enzyme in patients suffering from MMA, which presently has no authorized medical treatment or investigational medicines that can address the underlying cause.

Zaks further added that as the first of the company’s rare disease programs to start clinical trial enrollment, the company looks forward to hearing from the enrolled patients and families in the company’s clinical study as it investigates and advances an mRNA platform that might help treat this challenging condition.

The U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has granted mRNA-3704 with Orphan Drug, Fast Track, and Rare Pediatric Disease designation. mRNA-3704 has also received orphan designation by the EMA (European Medicines Agency). Moderna is presently planning to start its several sites outside the United States and thus far got MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) approval in U.K.

Credible sources cite, this new Model 3 variant would have a greater driving range. Like the existing Model 3 that is made in China, which boasts of a standard range of over 400 kilometers, the new variant would also be a rear-wheel-drive vehicle.

The new China-made Model 3 Long Range RWD is another version of Model 3 which was previously discontinued in the United States. The company has already manufactured more than 2,000 cars this year.

Tesla offered the Model 3 vehicle along with a Long Range battery pack and RWD (rear-wheel-drive) configuration when it first launched the Model 3 car.

However, this model was discontinued later as the company began to offer the Long Range battery together with a dual-motor AWD (all-wheel-drive) drivetrain.

Tesla, which began delivering its cars from December 2019 from the its $2 billion Tesla Shanghai factory, also sells imported Model 3s with a longer-range and an all-wheel drive across China.

The EV maker began manufacturing from its Shanghai factory on Monday following the end of an extended government holiday which was put in place owing to the coronavirus outbreak in the country.

The shares of the company surged by 9% after the reopening of the Shanghai factory.

Speaking of the factory closure due to coronavirus outbreak, Xu Wei, Shanghai municipal government spokesman stated that considering the practical problems major vehicle manufacturing companies have faced during the resuming of their production activities, the government would take efforts to help automakers restart their manufacturing activities as soon as possible.

It was expected that the Tesla Shanghai factory closure would delay some Model 3 deliveries. However, this shutdown is not expected to make a significant impact on the automobile manufacturer’s Q1 financial results, given that the new Shanghai factory has yet to establish itself as a major revenue contributor.
